        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        Hello! I am Zeeshan Manzoor from Kashmir. I have a passion for learning and sharing knowledge about technology, coding, and digital skills. I love creating websites, exploring new programming languages, and helping students succeed in their studies and life.  
        <br><br>
        I believe that every student has the potential to become successful if they are guided and motivated properly. Through my work, I want to provide tutorials, tips, and tools that will make learning easy, interesting, and effective.  
        <br><br>
        My goal is to inspire students to dream big, work hard, and achieve their goals. I am constantly learning new skills in web development, design, and technology to improve my abilities and share them with others.  
        <br><br>
        I am focused, determined, and ready to face challenges to become a successful professional in the field of technology. This website is a small step towards showing my skills and sharing my journey with others.
