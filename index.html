  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is <b>Ziya</b> and I am a student from <b>Kashmir</b>. I am very interested
    in technology and computers. Currently, I am learning
    <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b> to become a good web developer.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy creating websites, learning new coding skills, and improving myself
    every day. I believe that technology can change lives, and I want to build
    useful and creative projects in the future.
  </p>

  <p>
    Along with web development, I also like learning about computers, the internet,
    and modern technologies. My goal is to become skilled in programming and
    build professional websites and applications.
